# E-commerce-Event-Driven-Product-Management

In this challenge, you will create a simple e-commerce product management system that dynamically updates product details based on user interaction. This challenge will test your ability to handle events using JavaScript and demonstrate how separating HTML and JavaScript files can lead to better code organization and modularity.

Scenario: An online retail store wants to improve the user experience by dynamically updating product information based on user selections. The productâ€™s price should automatically change when a user selects different product options (e.g., size or color). Additionally, the system should display real-time availability and dynamically enable or disable purchase options based on stock levels.
